Low-Res Human Male Poly with Bones and a few Poses by vaerekel on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1457466

Summary:
Just messing around in Blender some more - working with creating models from reference images and playing with bones for posing. Low-Res human male. The anatomy/topology may not be the best and some of the bones (like the shoulder) aren't perfect. Feel free to change it up or do whatever!I haven't done any test prints for it, but it should not be too difficult to print, even if you want to add armors/weapons/accessories.Slightly humorous poses provided.Enjoy
